        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Momos are a type of steamed filled dumpling in Tibetan and Nepali cuisine that is also popular in neighbouring Bhutan, Bangladesh, and India.
            The majority of Tibetan momos are half-moon in shape like jiaozi, while Nepali momos are normally round like baozi.
             Momos are usually served with a sauce known as achar influenced by the spices and herbs used within many South Asian cuisines. 
            It can also be used in soup, as in jhol momo and mokthuk.</p>

            <li>Water as needed</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients for filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup Cabbage</li>
            <li>¼ cup Carrot Finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Garlic</li>
            <li>4 sprig Spring onion</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Black pepper powder</li>
            <li>1 sp Soya sauce</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour, salt and oil in a bowl and add water to make a smooth pliable dough. 
            Just like our poori dough. Keep aside covered.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan with oil, add garlic, and finely chopped white part of the spring onion. 
            Give a stir in high flame. Add the chopped veggies, sugar and fry in high flame for a minute.</li>
            <li>Add salt, pepper, soy sauce and mix well. Lastly add finely chopped green part of the spring onion and 
                mix for a minute in medium flame. 
                Switch off and keep aside.</li>
            <li>I rolled the dough into a big disc and used a big lid to cut into smaller discs. 
                After that I again roll to make it more thin. Keep some stuffing we prepared in the middle.</li>
            <li>Fold it to make momo shapes</li>
            <li>Steam it in a steamer spaced properly, for 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
