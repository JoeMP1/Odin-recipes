        <p>Fried chicken has been described as being "crunchy" and "juicy",as well as "crispy".The dish has also been called "spicy" and "salty".
            Occasionally, fried chicken is also topped with chili like paprika, or hot sauce to give it a spicy taste.<strong>This is especially common in fast food restaurant chains such as KFC.</strong>
            The dish is traditionally served with mashed potatoes, gravy, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, corn or biscuits.</p>

            It has even been reported that some of those who enjoy eating the food limit themselves to eating it only a certain number of times a year, to keep their fat intake reasonably low.
